# ASCII-Art Java
The application can translate any JPG-picture to an ASCII-Art-Picture (white chars on black background) 

## System requirements
- Java 8
- a minimum of 2 GB free RAM

*Please Note*: Images genrated with this application have ~20 times more pixels then the original. I have tested pictures with 800 * 800 pixels without any problems. Larger images may load very long and need a lot of RAM to render.

## How to use
- Select "Invert Colors" if you want to render a image with white background and black chars
- Click "Select picture" and select a valid JPG-picture
- The application starts to render the picture, this may take a short while
- Finished, a message appears on the window and you can press "Save picture" to save the generated picture where you want
- Now you can generate another one
